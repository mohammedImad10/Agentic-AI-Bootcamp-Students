"""
Web search tool for the Module 2 bridge project.

PRE-WRITTEN FOR YOU. You do not need to change anything in this file.
Read it if you are curious, then import web_search() and get on with the
interesting part - deciding what your agent does with the result.

No API key. No extra install. Uses `requests`, which you already have.

    from search_tools import web_search
    evidence = web_search("who founded Anthropic")

It returns a plain-text block of numbered findings with source URLs, or one
of two markers you must handle:

    NO_RESULTS          the search worked, but found nothing useful
    SEARCH_UNAVAILABLE  the network or the service failed

Those two are NOT the same thing, and your agent should not treat them the
same way. "I found nothing" is a real finding. "I could not look" is not.
