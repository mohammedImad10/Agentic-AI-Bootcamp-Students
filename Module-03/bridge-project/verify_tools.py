"""
Check your tools against reality before you build anything on top of them.

    python verify_tools.py

Every case hits the live GLEIF register and the live OFAC list, and checks the
answer against something independently true. If this passes, your plumbing is
sound and any bug after this point is in your agent.

If it fails, fix it first. Debugging a graph on top of a broken tool is the
most expensive hour you can spend.
